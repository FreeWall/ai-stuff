# Council

Before an audit, address outstanding PR comments, fix known issues, and run
relevant checks. Give council the updated implementation; do not defer known
fixes until reviews return. If the user wants to discard the implementation
and explore new ideas, skip fixes to code being replaced.

Bring in delegates to help with the user's request, usually for review or
feedback. Use one strong model per provider, at high reasoning effort. If the
user's instructions name council members, use those. Otherwise read
`members.md` in this skill's directory and use the members listed there.

In T3 Code, use `orchestrator_capabilities` to resolve the models, then
`delegate_task` to start one delegate per model in parallel. Elsewhere, use
the harness's subagent tools. If a member is unavailable, report it instead
of substituting.

Give each delegate the request and relevant context. For review or feedback,
keep their work read-only. Collect their responses and summarize the useful
findings, disagreements, and recommended next steps.

Treat each round as a barrier. Do not edit files until every delegate in the
round has returned or been cancelled. While waiting, you may verify findings
read-only (read code, reproduce, plan fixes). Then triage all findings
together and apply one batch of agreed fixes before starting the next round.

For a code review, ask each delegate for a score out of 10.
Count each full review pass as one round.
A fresh review after fixes starts a new round.

If the work ends in a pull request, put the results in the PR description.
Put this section before the model and harness line at the end:

```markdown
## Council review

Rounds: 2

| Delegate | Round 1 | Round 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opus 5.5 | 7/10 | 9/10 |
| Grok 4.7 | 8/10 | 10/10 |
```

If a delegate gives no score, write `no score`. Do not invent one.
If the PR is open, edit the description. Do not post a comment for this.
If there is no PR, put the same results in the final reply only.

If you agree with their recommendations, make the changes and request a fresh
review after. Continue this process until all delegates are satisfied with the
outcome.

Do not let repeated reviews result in scope creep. It is your job to fight to
keep scope limited.
